# KOTOR Party AI Restorer
This mod provides a utility armband that allows the player to the check the status of party memberâ€™s AI, and re-enable it if required. There are certain points in the game where the party may have their AI disabled for a cutscene, but in rare instances a bug prevents it from being re-enabled afterwards.

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/DarthParametric/KOTOR_Party_AI_Restorer/releases/latest). Add the armband item `dp_i_fix_ai_band` via console with "giveitem" command or KSE and equip it. Activating it will bring up a computer console that will allow you to both check and enable the AI flags for the currently active party members.
